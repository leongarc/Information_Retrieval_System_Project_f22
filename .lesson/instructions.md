  ## Code checklist:
  Make sure that you pay attention for the following with each project step that you finish:
  1. **Readme file**: it needs to explain what this project is about and any resources you obtained information from. The readme file needs to be added to the project code as well as submitting it. The extension for the Readme file is .md.
  2. **Authorship information**: For every block of code you write, write your name, indicate the beginning and the end of that block. 
  3. **Meeting Log**: make sure that it is included in every submission. It needs to include information regarding who attended the meeting, how long the meeting was, and what was discussed.
  4. **Code Documentation**: you need to document your code and explain what each function and class does.
  5. **Naming convention**: you need to pick suitable and meaningful names to your functions and classes.
  6. **File naming**: it needs to match the name of the class implemented in that file. Each class needs to be included in its own file.
